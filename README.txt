GAME MANUAL

Hi player! Thank you for your interest in my game.
Here's how to play:

At first, the game lets you choose the difficulty level.
After you choose, the game starts, and the targets start to appear.
The targets will come from both right and left on three different heights.
Your goal is to eliminate all 45 of them, which makes you win the game.

CONTROLS:
You control the player's movement by clicking your mouse.
The player will always move towards where the mouse was clicked.
Also, if the mouse was clicked above the player, he will jump,
allowing you to shoot the targets coming from different heights. 
To shoot the bullet and eliminate the targets, use your spacebar.
There are no limits to the amount of bullets you can shoot.

The difficulty levels differ from each other on the basis of targets velocity
and the rate it increases.

That's it! Go and play. Enjoy :)

Note that even though those symbols will be referred to as enemies or targets,
the idea is that each of the above models represent a deadline/assignment
or a book to read that has to be taken care of and eliminated as fast as possible.
If the player allows the assignments to stack above him, it will be very difficult
to eliminate them and win the game. The game is not supposed to be offensive
in any way by referring to the IB symbol or extended essay as enemies of the player.
Such choice of words is used as those are the expected labels in a game with shooting mechanics.
